# **_Emmanuel Rosario_** - Personal Portfolio Website

A Simple yet effective website to showcase what I have to offer. It was all done by me.
I wanted to showcase my skills as a front-end developer. This website showcases that with great design in both UI and UX decisions.
I made the website as easy to navigate, with a sticky Navbar.

## âœ¨ Inspiration ðŸŒŸ

<details> 
<summary>  <b> Design</b> </summary>

My inspiration for my website was to be reminscent of the older desktop's crash screens. Primarily with the color scheme, fonts and overall feel that was provided. Below are some examples that I took inspiration from.

### vv Windows 11 Crash vv

<img src="./public/Website-Design/Windows-11-Crash.webp" alt="Windows 11 Crash Screen"/>

### vv Windows 9x Crash vv

<img src="./public/Website-Design/Windows_9X_BSOD.png" alt="Windos 9X Crash"/>

<br>

These screens were created to be simple yet invoke a sense of urgancy to the user. Displaying text that just described to the issue with the computer.

_Within the website, I didn't want to give that sense of urgency at that level of intensity. Rather, give the feeling of professional yet simple. So I implemented more colors and used shape to help display that. Curving edges, softer type and using warm and inviting colors._

## Layouts

Below are mock-ups created within Figma. They show my thought process and planning phase before embarking on this project.

**_I started with a mobile design first before going to the desktop design. I did this because I knew I wanted to use Tailwind within this project._**

**_They are general layouts that were planned for the website. Some alterations were made due to personal preferences._**

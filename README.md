# **_Emmanuel Rosario_** - Personal Portfolio Website

A Simple yet effective website to showcase what I have to offer. It was all done by me.
I wanted to showcase my skills as a front-end developer. This website showcases that with great design in both UI and UX decisions.
I made the website as easy to navigate, with a sticky Navbar.
